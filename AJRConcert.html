        <p>I want to tell you a story.</p>
        <p>I attended the AJR concert in Boston on August 3, 2024. It was by far one the of best experiences I ever had, so let's start at the beginning of the story.</p>
        <p>I originally bought tickets for the Houston concert on July 9th, but Hurricane Beryl ravaged through Southern Texas just a few days before the concert. And sadly, AJR cancelled the concert.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <h3><a class="formatA" href="https://x.com/AJRBrothers/status/1810493171803328972">AJR Twitter Post</a> </h3>
            <h3>8:56 PM : Jul 8, 2024</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, due to the impacts of Hurricane Beryl, we have to cancel our show tomorrow (July 9) in Houston at Toyota Center. With widespread power outages across the city, flooding, and down traffic lights, for the safety of our fans and the hundreds of people it takes to run these shows, it needed to be cancelled.</p>

            <p>While this was out of our hands, it's important to look out for your family, neighbors, and your community first. We appreciate your understanding and hope everyone stays safe out there.</p>
            
            <p>If you purchased tickets through AXS, refunds will be issued automatically. If you purchased from a third-party reseller (StubHub, SeatGeek, VividSeats) etc, you will need to reach out to those outlets directly to request a refund.</p>

        <p>I had waited almost a full year for the concert. Through my grief, I realized they were performing in Boston just 1 day after my WPI summer program, located just outside Boston, ends. Worcester is closer to Boston than Katy is to Houston. That means this is the PERFECT show to attend.</p>
        <p>And even though there was no Wi-Fi at home due to the destruction of Hurricane Beryl, I begged my mom to drive to Seven Lakes High School, where there was Wi-Fi. There, we bought tickets to the Boston concert.</p>
        <p>Tickets to the pit were cheaper than the best seated-tickets. On top of that, people in the pit are closer to the stage than those with seated-tickets. So I bought 2 tickets for the pit. It costed about 800 dollars, if I remember correctly. Yes, the tickets were expensive.</p>
        <p>Fast forward 1 month, to the day after my WPI summer program ended: August 3, 2024.</p>
        <p>I woke up at 6 in the morning to pick up wristbands. Apparently, for some concerts, people hand out numbered wristbands in the morning to serve as a reservation. To get a lower number, you have to get a wristband as early as you can. At the time of the concert, people with smaller numbers on their wristband will go to the front of the line, and people with higher numbers have to line up behind them. However, there were no wristbands for this concert. I woke up early, woke mom up, walked to TD Garden (where the concert is held) at 7AM, just to find out no one is handing out wristbands for this concert.</p>
        <p>Okay. The day started out rough. I spent the rest of the morning and afternoon walking the Freedom Trail at Boston. Finally, after what seemed like ages, it was 4:00. 2 hours before the concert.</p>
        <p>I arrived at TD Garden at 4:30, ate pizza, and at 5:00, I lined up to enter the arena.</p>
        <p>Just a few minutes before the doors to the arena opened, a guard walked up to my mom, and told her that her purse is too large to carry inside. It was your average-sized purse, but I guess they don't want people to bring bags inside.</p>
        <p> But unfortunately, this means that my mom had to walk back to our hotel (which was only 1 minute away from TD Garden anyways) to put her purse away. However, my brother was taking the final exam for AP Government (he took that course online) at the hotel room, so my mom had to walk ALL THE WAY BACK TO TD GARDEN, and drop her purse off at the locker area outside the arena.</p>
        <p>This took about 15 to 20 minutes, but I was finally able to enter the arena at around 5:20 with my mom. Thankfully, many people were buying merch, so there wasn't much people at the pit yet. After scanning my ticket and my mom's ticket using my phone, I RAN DOWN TO THE PIT, completely ditching my mom. I was able to secure the 3rd row from the stage, and I saved a spot down there for my mom. There were no seats down here at the pit, so we had to stand the entire time- which wasn't a big problem for me- but it was a big problem for my mom apparently (who cares though, am I right? Haha, in all seriousness, my mom survived the concert).</p>

        <p>The opener for AJR was Almost Monday and MXMToon. It was entertaining, and I enjoyed their songs, but obviously not as much as AJR's songs. They performed for about an hour and a half in total.</p>
        <p>At 7:30, the AJR concert began.</p>
        <p>Here is the setlist:</p>
        <div class="setList">
            <p>Maybe Man</p>
            <p>Sober Up</p>
            <p>Yes I'm a Mess</p>
            <p>I Won't and Birthday Party Mashup</p>
            <p>The DJ is Crying for Help</p>
            <p>God is Really Real</p>
            <p>The Good Part</p>
            <p>Bang!</p>
            <p>Inertia</p>
            <p>Touchy Feely Fool</p>
            <p>Karma</p>
            <p>Turning Out parts 1, 2, and 3 --Only Ryan sings, Adam and Jack go to the back of the Arena to prepare for the next song</p>
            <p>World's Smallest Violin --Sang from the audience</p>
            <p>Steve's Going to London --Adam and Ryan leave, Jack sings and then runs to the stage near the end of the song</p>
            <p>Burn the House Down</p>
            <p>The Dumb Song</p>
            <p>Begin with showing how they created Way Less Sad, transitions into the song</p>
            <p>100 Bad Days</p>
            <p>Weak</p>
            <p>2085</p>
        </div>
        <p>The concert was amazing. God is Really Real is a song about their father passing away, and so the entire arena turned their flashlights on. It looked so cool in person, but it was sad as well.</p>
        <img class="verticalImage" src="/assets/during GIRR.jpeg">
        <p>The entire concert was so fun. Every penny was worth it.</p>
        <p>Especially Jack's speech at the end, it made me tear up a bit. My mom served as my camera guy, recording the entire concert. If it's future me reading this, you MUST WATCH IT. If it's someone other than Samantha, you ALSO MUST WATCH IT. Part 1 consists of Weak and the 1st half of 2085. Part 2 consists of Jack's speech and the 2nd half of 2085.</p>

        <p>The ending was by far the most memorable. The middle of the concert was the most energetic. The beginning of the concert was the most awesome.</p>
        <p>If you want, you can watch the intro. Everyone was SCREAMING IN THE PIT. The pit was an AMAZING experience. The concert was amazing.</p>

        <p>After a year of waiting, almost not being able to attend the concert, I can finally say this: The Maybe Man Tour was amazing.</p>
        <p>Their next album will probably drop in 3 years. So, for the next concert, I will be in college. I want to pay for the tickets next time. This time, I only paid for 50% of my ticket, and my mom paid the rest. I want to pay 100% of my ticket, and 100% of my mom's ticket for AJR's next concert.</p>
        <p>And that is my story. My final words for you are: AJR is the best band in the world. No question.</p>
